title: "Evidence-based methods of communicating science to the public through data visualization"
schedule: "October, 2023"
abstract: "For eScience professionals at the forefront of innovation in collaborative, computationally-intensive, and
data-intensive research, effective communication of complex scientific/technical concepts is crucial to
engage diverse audiences and ensure the broader impact of this work. This tutorial on
cinematic scientific visualization offers a powerful science communication approach relevant to eScience
professionals’ needs. Benefitting from on decades of experience from the Advanced Visualization Lab at
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, participants will learn the intricacies of creating
high-quality, immersive visualizations that contextualize cutting-edge research in an accessible and
captivating manner. By leveraging tools from computational science communities and incorporating
findings from recent empirical research, this tutorial provides valuable insights and guidance for
eScience professionals to create visually compelling representations of data that resonate with a wide
range of audiences."
