title: "UnoAPI: Modern techniques for engineering high-performance software"
schedule: "October, 2023"
abstract: "One of the key goals in high-performance and distributed software engineering is to leverage the specific
capabilities of the target hardware to the extent possible. Today’s systems are typically heterogeneous,
where one or more architectures may be present within a single system, such as conventional CPU cores
combined with accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs. Although parallel computing itself has reached a
high level of maturity, as we move toward exascale and beyond computing, challenges similar to those
that plagued the earliest days of parallel and distributed computing are beginning to resurface: Leveraging
heterogeneity while balancing performance, software portability, and developer productivity (P3).
This tutorial provides hands-on experience in developing high-performance and embedded software for
heterogeneous architectures using Intel’s oneAPI reference implementation of the Khronos SYCL
standard in conjunction with state-of-the-art software engineering methods. By raising the abstraction
level via its unified application programming interface (API), oneAPI makes it easier to develop portable
high-performance software for systems with embedded hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and
FPGAs.
