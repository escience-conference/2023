The 19th IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience 2023) will be held in  Limassol, Cyprus on October 9-13, 2023 (to be confirmed). eScience 2023 welcomes paper submissions for the technical program, to be held on October 9-13, 2023.

eScience 2023 provides an interdisciplinary forum for researchers, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies. Its objective is to promote and encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools, with a strong focus on practical solutions and open challenges. The conference welcomes conceptualization, implementation, and experience contributions enabling and driving innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all disciplines, from the physical and biological sciences to the social sciences, arts, and humanities; encompassing artificial intelligence and machine learning methods; and targeting a broad spectrum of architectures, including HPC, cloud, and IoT.

**The overarching theme of eScience 2023 conference is “Democratizing eScience”. This year, the conference is emphasizing three key topics:**
-	Translational Research in Computer and Computational Sciences 
-	Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Science
-	Data and Data Democratization

The conference is soliciting three types of contributions:
-	**Full papers** (10 pages, IEEE format) presenting previously unpublished research achievements or eScience experiences and solutions
-	**Posters** (2 pages, IEEE format) showcasing early-stage results and innovations
-	**Abstracts** (max 300 words) either outlining early ideas on a possible research topic or communicating more mature interdisciplinary developments

All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed. Selected abstracts and full papers will receive a slot for an oral presentation. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted full papers, poster papers, and abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings through the IEEE Digital Library. Rejected full papers can be re-submitted for a poster presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper, poster, or abstract must register as an author at the full registration rate. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission.
