eScience 2023 provides an interdisciplinary forum for researchers, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies. Its objective is to promote and encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools, with a strong focus on practical solutions and open challenges. The conference welcomes conceptualization, implementation, and experience contributions enabling and driving innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all disciplines, from the physical and biological sciences to the social sciences, arts, and humanities; encompassing artificial intelligence and machine learning methods; and targeting a broad spectrum of architectures, including HPC, cloud, and IoT.

This year, the conference is promoting four additional key topics (tracks):
- Computational Science for sustainable development
- FAIR
- Research Infrastructures for eScience
- Continuum  Computing: Convergence between Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT)

The conference is soliciting two types of contributions:
- **Full papers (10 pages including references)** presenting previously unpublished research achievements or eScience experiences and solutions
- **Posters (2 pages)** showcasing early-stage results and innovations

Submitted papers should use the IEEE 8.5×11 manuscript guidelines: double-column text using single-spaced 10-point font on 8.5×11-inch pages. Templates are available from [http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 
All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed. Selected full papers will receive a slot for an oral presentation. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted full papers and poster papers will be published in the conference proceedings. Rejected full papers can be re-submitted for a poster presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper or poster must register as an author at the full registration rate. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission.

**Note.** The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.
