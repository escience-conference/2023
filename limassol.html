    <h3 style="margin-top: 0">Limassol, the city of fun</h3>
    However, it is undisputable that Limassol’s prosperity is not an achievement of nowadays. Since antiquity, Cyprus
    source of income has been wine, which according to testimonials was a “must” during religious events, festivals or
    even moments of sorrow. Wine production in Limassol has started thousands of years ago along with the vineyard
    plantation and, especially after 20th century, contributed in the city’s welfare, as it has become the centre of
    wineries.

<p>
    Limassol, a city counting centuries of history, is located between two of the most renowned ancient kingdoms of the
    island, Amathous at the east and Kourion at the west. “Lemessos” as it is called by locals, is the second largest
    urban area in Cyprus (after the capital, Nicosia) and its municipality is the most populous in the country with
    235,0oo inhabitants (2011 Census).

<p>
    Limassol is one of the fastest growing modern metropolises in Europe. The city's infrastructure is constantly
    upgraded from all aspects (way of living, public construction projects, education, etc) with the most distinct
    project of this sort being the Limassol Marina - an exclusive waterfront development combining elegant residences
    and a full service marina, with its own shopping and dining area. Also, the revamped coastline now covers a 15
    kilometres distance, lined with hotels and beach bars and cafes, interspersed with eucalyptus groves and linked by a
    promenade popular with walkers and joggers.
</p>

<p>
    In recent years Limassol has progressed as one of the largest commercial ports in the Mediterranean region and it is
    now considered as one of the most important centres of tourism, trade and offshore companies. The city is also the
    business and financial centre of Cyprus as hundreds of international shipping and financial companies have their
    headquarters here.

        <h4>Limassol Castle</h4>
        There is no doubt that Limassol Castle occupies the dominant position in the landmark and tourist attractions in
        the city. Richard the Lionheart is supposed to have married his fiancée Princess Berengaria of Navarre in this
        castle after her ship was grounded as she accompanied him to the Third Crusade, on his way to Holy Land. The
        Castle was used as a prison between 1790 and 1940 and it now serves as a medieval museum. The collection that
        the museum provides covers the era of 400 – 1870 AD. A visitor can see numerous exhibits: cannons, wood carvings
        of the 17th and 18th century, paintings and tombstones, statues, suits of armour, coins, terracotta, metalware
        and pottery, glass and marble articrafts.

        <h4>Amathus Ruins</h4>
        The ancient city of Amathus on the southern coast of Agios Tychonas is one of the oldest imperial cities on the
        island. There have been many myths behind the origin of this city, one of them believing in Cinyras as the
        city’s founder, whose son Adonis named the city after his mother Amathus. Hellenic myth would have Amathus built
        by one of the sons of Heracles who was worshipped there. The city had a very special place for Aphrodite, the
        goddess of beauty and love. Visitors at the ruins can perceive an era that existed 3000 years ago, through the
        mythical excavations and artefacts.
