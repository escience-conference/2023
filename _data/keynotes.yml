  abstract: "We are on the verge of a global communications revolution based on ubiquitous high-speed optical, 5G, 6G, and free-space optics technologies. The resulting communications fabric can enable new ultra-collaborative research modalities that pool sensors, data, and computation with unprecedented flexibility and focus. But realizing these new modalities requires that we overcome the friction that currently impedes actions that traverse institutional boundaries. The solution, I argue, is new global science services to mediate between user intent and infrastructure realities. I describe our experiences building and operating such services, and present examples of their application and use."
