- name: '3rd Workshop on Reproducible Workflows, Data Management, and Security (ReWorDS 2023)'
  abstract: >
            Emerging and future computational workloads are combining traditional HPC applications with tools and techniques from the scale-out data analytics and machine learning community. Getting these technologies to co-exist and interoperate to advance scientific discovery is a daunting task with few known good solutions. In general, constructing these workflows has the potential to create pitfalls and incompatibilities that limit adoption.

            This workshop seeks to explore ideas and experiences on what kinds of infrastructure developments can improve upon the state of the art. Explorations of component packaging via containers and virtual machines, automation scripting, deployment,  portability builds, and system support for these and other relevant activities are key infrastructure.

- name: 'Software Engineering for eScience 2023 (SE4eScience23)'
  abstract: >
            The goal of this workshop is to provide a unique venue for the presentation of results and 
            to facilitate interaction between software engineers and computational scientists, including 
            those from the humanities, social sciences and engineering. The workshop seeks contributions 
            from members of those communities that describe perspectives, research outcomes, and lessons 
            learned (positive or negative) from the development of eScience software.

- name: 'Research Software Engineers in eScience: Sustainable RSE Ecosystems within eScience (RSE-eScience-2023)'
  abstract: >
            Research Software Engineers (RSEs) combine professional software engineering expertise 
            with an intimate understanding of research. They are uniquely placed in the eScience 
            ecosystem to ensure development of sustainable research environments and reproducible 
            research outputs. However, the position of RSEs within eScience is still not fully 
            established, with many RSEs not gaining proper recognition for their contributions and 
            struggling to find a way to progress their careers. The theme of this workshop is 
            sustainable RSE ecosystems, encompassing both the role of RSEs in sustainable eScience 
            and making the RSE ecosystem itself more sustainable. We intend for this workshop to 
            raise awareness of the concept of research software engineers and research software 
            engineering (RSEng), as well as to provide an opportunity for RSEs and those interested 
            in RSEng to talk about issues and solutions. Anyone involved or interested in RSEng is 
            welcome to attend.

- name: '3rd Workshop on E-science ReseaRch leading tO negative Results (ERROR 2023)'
  abstract: > 
            ERROR 2023 provides the e-Science community a dedicated and active forum for exchanging 
            cross-discipline experiences on research leading to negative results and lessons learned. 
            The workshop covers both applications and systems areas, including topics in research 
            methodology, reproducibility, the applications/systems interface, social problems in 
            computational science, and other relevant areas.
