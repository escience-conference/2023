  IEEE eScience 2023 brings together leading interdisciplinary research communities,
  developers and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies. The
  objective of the eScience Conference is to promote and encourage all aspects of
  eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms and tools with
  a strong focus on practical solutions and challenges. eScience 2023 interprets
  eScience in its broadest meaning that enables and improves innovation in data- and
  compute-intensive research across all domain sciences ranging from traditional areas
  in physics and earth sciences to more recent fields such as social sciences, arts and
  humanities, and artificial intelligence for a wide variety of target architectures 
  including HPC, cloud and IoT infrastructures.
  <br /><br />
  The 19th IEEE International Conference on e-Science is co-located with the 
  <strong><a href="https://www.theglobalresearchplatform.net/" target="_blank">4th 
  Global Research Platform Workshop (4GRP)</a></strong>. 
  Both audiences share common interests, content, and 
  culture. Co-location provides attendees with the option to register for both events.
